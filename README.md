# Bayesian inference and stochastic sampling in (astro)physics

[Davide Gerosa](https://davidegerosa.com/) — davide.gerosa@unimib.it  

University of Milano-Bicocca, 2026.

This is a mini-course deliver at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, in February 2026. 

## Aims

Extracting knowledge from data—the numbers we measure in physics—requires rigorous statistical inference. This mini-course introduces the fundamentals of Bayesian reasoning and its role in modern scientific analysis.
Participants will explore key stochastic sampling methods, including **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** and, time permitting, **nested sampling**. The session concludes with a hands-on astrophysics example, guiding students through a complete inference workflow in practice.

## Lisbon 2026

I prepared this material for a mini-course delivered at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, in February 2026. This is a subset of what I usually teach in my class [Astrostatistics and Machine Learning](https://github/dgerosa.github.io/astrostatistics) at the University of Milano-Bicocca; so have a look there if you want more stats material.
