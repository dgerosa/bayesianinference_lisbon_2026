# Bayesian inference and stochastic sampling in (astro)physics

[Davide Gerosa](https://davidegerosa.com/) — davide.gerosa@unimib.it  

University of Milano-Bicocca, 2026.

This is a mini-course deliver at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, in February 2026. 

## Course Description

Extracting knowledge from data—the numbers we measure in physics—requires rigorous statistical inference. This mini-course introduces the fundamentals of Bayesian reasoning and its role in modern scientific analysis.
Participants will explore key stochastic sampling methods, including **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** and, time permitting, **nested sampling**. The session concludes with a hands-on astrophysics example, guiding students through a complete inference workflow in practice.


## Meet the lecturer

**Davide Gerosa** completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge in 2016. He then held a NASA postdoctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology and later a faculty appointment at the University of Birmingham. Since 2021, he has been an associate professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, where he leads a research group in gravitational-wave astronomy supported by the European Research Council. His core research interests include the dynamics of black-hole binaries, gravitational-wave data analysis, and related applications of artificial intelligence.
