# Bayesian inference and stochastic sampling in (astro)physics

[Davide Gerosa](https://davidegerosa.com/) — davide.gerosa@unimib.it  

University of Milano-Bicocca, 2026.

This is a mini-course deliver at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, in February 2026.  

## Course Description

Extracting knowledge from data—the numbers we measure in physics—requires rigorous statistical inference. This mini-course introduces the fundamentals of Bayesian reasoning and its role in modern scientific analysis.

Participants will explore key stochastic sampling methods, including **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** and, time permitting, **nested sampling**. The session concludes with a hands-on astrophysics example, guiding students through a complete inference workflow in practice.


## Meet the Lecturer

**Davide Gerosa** completed his PhD at the [University of Cambridge](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1) in 2016. He then held a NASA postdoctoral fellowship at the [California Institute of Technology](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2) and later a faculty appointment at the [University of Birmingham](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3).

Since 2021, he has been an associate professor at the [University of Milano-Bicocca](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4), where he leads a research group in gravitational-wave astronomy supported by the European Research Council. His core research interests include the dynamics of black-hole binaries, gravitational-wave data analysis, and related applications of artificial intelligence.
